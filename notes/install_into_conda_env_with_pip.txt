1. Run 'conda create -n venv_name' and 'conda activate venv_name', where venv_name is the name of your virtual environment.
2. Run conda install pip (if not installed already). This will install pip to your venv directory.
3. Run 'pip install package'. Should be installed in the current conda environment.
