1. Create new environment in PyCharm terminal or in Anaconda Prompt:
$ conda create --name ENVNAME python=3.9
Check where it is:
$ conda env list

2. In PyCharm, go to File -> Settings -> Tools -> Terminal.

3. Replace the value in "Shell path" with
cmd.exe "/K" C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Scripts\activate.bat path_to_your_environment

***

The above only does this: when you open the terminal in PyCharm, you're in the correct environment.
But the project is still run in the default environment, not the one you created with Anaconda. To fix this:

1. File -> Settings -> Project: ... -> Python Interpreter
2. Click on the Settings icon next to the combo box -> Add... -> Conda Environment
3. If the environment was already created in the terminal, choose Existing Environment
