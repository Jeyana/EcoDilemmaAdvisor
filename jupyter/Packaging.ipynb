    "**Initial question** (Jeyana): If I use washable plastic containers and bags when shopping (instead of single-use plastics), does it actually help to reduce my impact?<br>\n",
    "**Short answer**: Yes, if you wash them at least 15 times before throwing them away. You'll use more water, but reduce CO2 emissions and the amount of waste (especially if your containers/bags are recyclable and will actually be recycled at the end of use). If possible, go for either 100% cotton or 100% polyester bags. Blended fibers can be recycled, but the process is much more complicated than for single fibre products (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X19305100).
